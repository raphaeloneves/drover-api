You can access a live documentation after running the project and accessing the [swagger-ui](http://localhost:3000/api-docs) page.

## Test suite

### Running the tests

```
bundle exec rspec
```

### Test scope

`models/*`, `validators/*`, `controllers/*`

### Test count

`44 examples`

### Current coverage

`100%`

After running the test suite, automatically a report containing the test coverage will be generated and can be accessed after running the project at [localhost](http://localhost:3000/coverage/index.html#_AllFiles)

## Extra configuration files

- Rspec: under `spec/*`
- Shoulda Matchers: under `spec/spec_helper.rb`
- DatabaseCleaner: under `spec/spec_helper.rb`
- FactoryBot: under `spec/spec_helper.rb`
- Validation Support: under `spec/support/validation_support.rb`
- Simplecov: under `spec/spec_helper.rb`

## Important note (credits)

- The `Filterable` module was inspired on Justin Weiss post [Search and Filter Rails Models Without Bloating Your Controller](https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/search-and-filter-rails-models-without-bloating-your-controller/), giving my personal touch/modification.

## Feed for further discussion

- Minitest has been replaced by Rspec as test suite.

- Handled query n + 1 problems on makers, models and cars
